# AndroidDateTimeFormatters

This library provides a `DateTimeFormatter` that respects Android's 12-/24-hour clock system setting. Two versions of
the library existâ€”one for java.time types and another for [ThreeTenABP](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP).

This library was created to address ThreeTenABP issue [#16](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP/issues/16) after
Jake indicated he
[does not want to add this util](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP/pull/103#issuecomment-498429319) directly to
ThreeTenABP.
