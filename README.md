# AndroidDateTimeFormatters
[![](https://github.com/drewhamilton/AndroidDateTimeFormatters/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/drewhamilton/AndroidDateTimeFormatters/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amain)

This library provides a `DateTimeFormatter` that respects Android's 12-/24-hour clock system
setting. Two versions of the library existâ€”one for `java.time` types and another for
[ThreeTenBP](https://github.com/ThreeTen/threetenbp) types.

With [core library desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring)
supported in Android Gradle Plugin 4.0+, the "datetimeformatters" artifact, using `java.time` types,
is considered the primary and preferred artifact. However, "datetimeformatters-threetenbp" can be
used in apps that still use ThreeTenBP. Both artifacts require a minimum Android SDK version of at
least 15.
